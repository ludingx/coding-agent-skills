# CodeRabbit triage

Use this reference when the Babysit playbook (`../playbooks/babysit.md`) handles CodeRabbit or review-automation comments. The goal is not to ignore CodeRabbit by default. The goal is to stop treating every comment as a required code change.

## Decision rubric

Classify each CodeRabbit thread before acting:

- `fix`: The comment identifies a plausible correctness, security, privacy, data loss, auth, billing, migration, idempotency, race, or shipped-behavior issue. Fix it in the lowest owning PR, then reply with the commit SHA and resolve the thread.
- `dismiss`: The comment matches a documented low-risk noisy pattern, and the current code/context proves the concern does not need a code change. Reply with a short reason and resolve the thread.
- `ask`: The comment is novel, high-severity, security/privacy/data-related, or ambiguous. Ask the user instead of guessing.

When in doubt, ask. Skipping a noisy code-quality comment is cheap; skipping a real data or security bug is not.

## Learned pattern format

Add future patterns in this shape:

```markdown
### <short pattern name>

- Confidence: candidate | recurring | strong
- Skip when: <conditions that must be true>
- Do not skip when: <risk boundaries>
- Example signal: <phrases or code context that identify the pattern>
- Source: <PR/comment URL or short historical note>
```

Use `candidate` for one or two examples. Use `recurring` after multiple real dismissals. Use `strong` only when the pattern is narrow, repeatedly verified, and low-risk.

## Ask by default

Do not auto-skip these categories, even if a previous PR dismissed something similar:

- Security, privacy, auth, billing, data retention, training-data, and permission-boundary findings.
- High-severity findings.
- Migration, schema, idempotency, concurrency, and cross-system behavior findings.
- Comments where the suggested fix is small and clearly reduces risk without changing product intent.

Historical data showed humans sometimes dismiss security/data-flow comments. Treat those as owner judgment calls, not team-wide skip rules.
