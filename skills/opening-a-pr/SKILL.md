### Opening a PR

Use when opening a PR.

**Worktree.** Work from a git worktree off main. Subagents inherit it. Dirty branch with unrelated work: patch out, fresh worktree, apply.

**Commits.** Commit liberally. Rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit. New commit when separable.

**PRs.** Run `/deslop` over the diff before commit. Run `/no-comments` before review. Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with `/technical-writing`, then apply `/unslop`. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** The PR body is a briefing, not the lab notebook. A reviewer who has the diff should learn why the change exists, what is out of scope, and how you proved the change works. The squash commit body is the PR body. If the body would make the squash commit longer than about 40 lines, cut the body.

Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it has nothing to say.

- `## Why`. State the intent and approach in one or two short paragraphs. Do not list SHAs or rebase genealogy. Do not add a "based on main" preamble.
- `## Scope`. Use bullets to list real symbols and paths. Name both sides of a rename or retarget. State what is in and out only when the boundary matters. Do not write a file-by-file essay.
- `## Tradeoffs`. Name only rejected alternatives that a reviewer would otherwise ask about. Skip this section when there was no real choice.
- `## Blast Radius`. In one to three sentences, name who or what the change touches and why the change is safe or risky. State the continuing cost if main stays red without the fix.
- `## Verification`. Name each real run path and its outcome. For a performance change, report one primary number with its unit in `before → after` form. Do not include sample-size methodology or metric tables.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not paste full SHAs or file-by-file checklists. Put these details in a linked artifact. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Forge.** Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation, editing, viewing, watching, and merging.

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk. Each child branch rebases onto its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. Create a child with `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>`. Retarget an existing child with `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Rebase on trunk before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Open every PR ready, never as a draft. With `gh`, omit `--draft`. If a PR still opens as a draft, run `gh pr ready <number>`. Run `gh pr view <number>` before you refer to PR status.
